											<p>In this paper, I focus on the concept of solidarity in the ethics of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
											as HIV prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM). Solidarity is a concept that is increasingly being 
											used in bioethics, especially feminist bioethics, in order to understand the broader effects of emerging 
											medical technologies on individuals as well as communities (Sherwin, 2008; Sherwin & Stockdale, 2017). I 
											use the recent academic work on solidarity to analyze and contextualize the ethics of PrEP in terms of 
											solidarity within gay communities in North America. Although the AIDS epidemic and early AIDS activism 
											necessitated solidarity among MSM, including the formation of groups like Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP, 
											this solidarity is being threatened today by new devleopments in HIV treatment and prevention and new developments 
											in society more broadly, including the successes of the gay rights movement, which are eroding the foundations 
											of this solidarity. Therefore, I highlight two challenges that PrEP presents to solidarity among MSM and the 
											normative implications of these challenges. First, PrEP exposes differences in sexual moralities among MSM by 
											reinforcing widespread social and political objections to its use based on its effects on safe sex, promiscuity, 
											and the stereotyping of gay, bisexual, and queer men in society. These objections to PrEP centre on the risks 
											associated with condomless sex, the recent changes in sexual and romantic relationship structures, and the strategy 
											of the gay rights movement respectively. Second, PrEP highlights differences in intergenerational views by exposing 
											how the legacy of the AIDS epidemic affects the views of HIV among MSM from different generations. The deep divisions 
											exposed by PrEP within gay communities along generational lines and lines of sexual morality demonstrate a clear 
											threat to solidarity. These challenges raise important questions about the use of PrEP as HIV prevention among MSM 
											today because of the specific critical and historical context of its use in North America. First, there are 
											epistemological questions about how to weigh the testimony of survivors of the AIDS epidemic against MSM who feel
											marginalized and alienated by established gay culture. Second, there are ethical questions about whether to take 
											community damage into account in thinking about how to advocate, advertise, and promote PrEP. Finally, I explain 
											how responding to these challenges can actually build, or rebuild, solidarity within gay communities. I consider 
											the kinds of opportunities that PrEP provides for building, or rebuilding, solidarity among MSM and within gay 
											commmunities around new understandings of non-traditional sexual behaviour, non-traditional sexual and romantic 
											relationships, and intergenerational differences. For example, if MSM discuss their views on sexual morality and 
											their experiences of HIV with each other more openly, then they can begin to understand how to better relate to 
											each other. Understanding how PrEP challenges solidarity among MSM helps us account for the social and political 
											dimensions of this emerging medical technology as well as the specific social and political effects of PrEP on 
											communities of MSM and gay, bisexual, and queer men in North America.</p>

											<p>In this paper, I will explore the ethics of using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as HIV prevention 
											for men who have sex with men (MSM). The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers MSM 
											to be the highest risk group for contracting HIV in North America. The ethics of using PrEP as HIV prevention 
											among MSM, however, has both a medical dimension and a social dimension. Whereas the medical dimension of the 
											ethics of PrEP includes concerns about side effects, drug resistance, and distribution, the social dimension 
											of the ethics of PrEP includes concerns about stigmatization, sexual and romantic relationships, and sexual 
											freedom. The medical concerns of the ethics of PrEP may take precedence over the social concerns, but there 
											is a growing body of literature that already addresses the medical concerns. Much less attention has been given 
											to the social concerns of the ethics of PrEP and in this paper I will fill this gap in the literature. Therefore, 
											I will focus on the often overlooked social dimension of the ethics of PrEP in order to help understand the

									<div id="riskofprep" class="collapse">
										<div class="card card-body mt-3">
											<p>In this paper, I argue that men who have sex with men (MSM) should embrace pre-exposure 
											prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy despite the risks involved in its use. 
											The most important ethical question about PrEP seems to be whether or not it is too risky 
											to be officially approved as HIV prevention and whether or not it is too risky to be used 
											by individuals who are at high risk for HIV. The debate about the ethical implications of 
											PrEP always involves risk of some kind to some degree, starting the with the risk assessment 
											of PrEP by regulatory agencies like Health Canada.</p><br>
											
											</p>However, the ongoing risk debate about PrEP usually focuses on certain medical risks, 
											including the risk of HIV, the risk of other STIs and the risk of promiscuity, and ignores 
											other social and political risks, including the risk of acquiring the stigma around PrEP, 
											the risk of reinforcing stereotypes about MSM and the risk of exacerbating divisions within 
											the MSM community. The philosophical literature on risk demonstrates that the present risk 
											assessment of PrEP is inadequate because it seems to rely on the classical model of risk 
											assessment, which endorses a neutral or value-free risk assessment. This obscures the social
											and political risks involved in PrEP use and the values that are involved in PrEP risk assessment.</p><br>
											
											</p>Furthermore, the present risk assessment influences the decisions of healthcare professionals, 
											policy makers and individuals by structuring their decisions about PrEP around medical conceptions 
											of risk. However, if we apply an alternative model of risk assessment to PrEP and we investigate 
											the risk assessment in the personal decisions of MSM in particular, then we can expose the many 
											different kinds of risks and benefits involved in PrEP use and the kinds of problematic value 
											assumptions involved in PrEP risk assessment. Brunk et al. (1991) provide an especially helpful 
											model that identifies several of the relevant kinds of value assumptions usually involved in risk 
											assessment. Unfortunately, the values of MSM are often ignored in medical issues because these 
											values are often different than those of the rest of society. For example, MSM often value non-traditional 
											sexual behaviour and non-traditional sexual and romantic relationships. As an oppressed social group, 
											MSM have unique experiences in society and these experiences lead to unique values that disrupt the 
											status quo. The fact that the controversy around PrEP is framed as a debate about risk actually 
											contributes to the reinforcement of what we think of as the risks associated with PrEP, the reinforcement 
											of what we think of as risky sexual behaviour and the reinforcement of harmful narratives about male 
											homosexuality and bisexuality. If the values of MSM are considered in PrEP risk assessment, then the 
											social and political benefits of PrEP become especially clear. Acknowledging the role of value assumptions 
											in the risk assessment of PrEP would improve the quality of its risk assessment and it would improve the 
											utility of PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy for MSM.</p>

									<div id="prep" class="collapse">
										<div class="card card-body mt-3">
											<p>In this paper, I explore the ethics of using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as HIV
											prevention for men who have sex with men (MSM) by comparing it to the use of the birth control
											pill among women. The history of the birth control pill demonstrates how new medical
											technologies can really affect the social lives of people who use them. Although the medical
											concerns about the ethics of new medical technologies like PrEP may take precedence over the
											social concerns, there is a strong focus in literature on these medical concerns. I focus on the
											often overlooked social dimension of the ethics of PrEP and I investigate how PrEP affects the
											social lives of MSM, especially as it becomes more widely available in Canada. I argue that
											PrEP increases access to the social goods of sexual relationships, romantic relationships and
											sexual freedom for MSM in general.</p><br>
											
											<p>However, there are many social objections to the use of
											PrEP by MSM that argue that PrEP actually increases risky sexual behaviour. I find that it is
											helpful to compare PrEP to the birth control pill in order to respond to such objections because
											similar arguments were levelled against the birth control pill in the past. Both PrEP and the birth
											control pill help prevent unwanted outcomes of sex; PrEP helps prevent HIV infection and the
											birth control pill helps prevent pregnancy. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the use of the
											birth control pill by women does not reliably increase their risky sexual behaviour. Therefore, I
											argue that PrEP does not increase risky sexual behaviour either. The birth control pill has
											increased sexual activity, the number of sexual partners and the risk of STIs, pregnancy and
											abortions for women. Nevertheless, increased sexual behaviour is not regarded as a reason to
											prohibit women’s access to the birth control pill. In fact, the birth control pill actually helps
											empower women by allowing them to take control of their sexuality and their sexual health.
											PrEP similarly empowers gay men, bisexual men and other MSM because it increases their
											control over their sexuality and their sexual health, which increases their sexual freedom in
											general.</p><br> 
											
											<p>Although the birth control pill and PrEP are usually studied in different populations, the
											success of the birth control pill for women suggests that reducing the risk of unwanted outcomes
											of sex does not necessarily lead to increased risky sexual behaviour. This comparison is
											important for issues of social justice in the health care of MSM. MSM, as a social group, have
											specific health care challenges and opportunities because of the approval of PrEP for HIV
											prevention in Canada in 2016. The comparison between PrEP and the birth control pill also
											raises difficult questions about access to health care, responsibility, power, relationship
											dynamics, social acceptance and mental health. Although the birth control pill is not perfect, it is
											important to learn lessons from the experience of women using the birth control pill in order to
											optimize the use of PrEP for HIV prevention among MSM.</p>

											<p>In this presentation, I explore the ethics of using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as HIV prevention 
											for men who have sex with men (MSM). I focus on the Canadian social, legal and medical context where PrEP 
											was approved in 2016, but I also draw on information from the American context where PrEP was approved 
											in 2012.</p><br>

											<p>Although the medical concerns about the ethics of PrEP often take precedence over the social concerns, 
											there is a growing body of literature in bioethics that addresses the medical concerns. Therefore, I focus 
											on the sometimes overlooked social dimension of the ethics of PrEP. Whereas the medical dimensions of the 
											ethics of PrEP include issues of safety, drug resistance and access among others, the social dimensions of 
											the ethics of PrEP include issues of serodiscordance, stigmatization and sexual freedom. I argue that PrEP 
											increases access to the goods of sex and romantic relationships for MSM and reduces the stigmatization of 
											both HIV positive people and people who are at high risk of contracting HIV, such as MSM. I conclude that 
											PrEP increases the sexual freedom of MSM, including those who are HIV positive and those who are HIV 
											negative. </p><br>

											<p>Furthermore, I explain how the analogy between PrEP and the birth control pill is helpful for 
											understanding this sexual freedom; the ways in which the birth control pill empowers women is similar 
											to the the ways in which PrEP empowers MSM. However, this analogy is also helpful for understanding some 
											of the complexities and limitations on this sexual freedom. I address these complexities and limitations 
											in order to further analyze the extent of the sexual freedom that PrEP affords MSM.<p>

											<p>In this paper, I explore the ethics of using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as HIV prevention
											for men who have sex with men (MSM). Although the medical concerns about the ethics of
											PrEP may take precedence over the social concerns, there is a growing body of literature that
											addresses the medical concerns. Therefore, I focus on the often overlooked social dimension of
											the ethics of PrEP. I argue that PrEP increases access to the goods of sex and romantic
											relationships for MSM and reduces the stigmatization of HIV positive people and people who
											are at high risk of contracting HIV.</p>
